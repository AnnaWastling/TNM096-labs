#  Define maxsteps

# Define the classes

# Loop through the maxsteps

# Create randomized inital 8 by 3 table of the classes

# Define constraints

# Check which classes are in current conflict and how many conflict, return list of them

# Sort the list according to the class with the least conflicts

# Question:
# 1: How do we move the classes in this problem? Do we switch a class in conflict
# with another class (also in conflict or not in conflict) or do we only switch
# with the two empty blocks?


# 2: Do we ever move the classes that has no conflict?
